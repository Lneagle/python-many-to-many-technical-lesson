# Technical Lesson: Many-to-Many Relationships

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will explore how to apply inheritance, class attributes, and methods.

---

## Scenario

Imagine you're working for a school administration system that keeps track of all students and all courses. This is a **many-to-many** relationship because:

- A student has many courses
- A course has many students

To connect the two, we will use a **Schedule** class as an intermediary.

---

## Goals

- Create an intermediary class
- Build relationships to allow access between classes
- Build properties to ensure class connection
